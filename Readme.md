## Description
Our project involves the development of a B2C e-commerce website using Python Flask, Postgres SQL, and SQLAlchemy ORM. The website offers a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products online. It provides various features to enhance the shopping experience, including product search, cart management, and secure checkout using the Stripe API. The general purpose of this project is to make a web application with proper functioning frontend and backend (a database providing all the necessary tables and data) for a General Purpose E-commerce website based on the concept of B2C (Business to Consumer).
